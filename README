NAME
    Devel::GlobalDestruction::Warn - Warn if object is at global destruction

SYNOPSIS
      package Foo;
      use Devel::GlobalDestruction::Warn;

    From command line:

      $ perl -MDevel::GlobalDestruction::Warn leak.pl

DESCRIPTION
    Global destruction means that you didn't freed the resources previously.
    It might be a sight of memory leaking so it is very useful to warn if
    any destructor was called at global destruction.

ENVIRONMENT
    If the `PERL_DEVEL_GLOBALDESTRUCTION_WARN_VERBOSE' or `PERL_DGW_VERBOSE'
    variable is true value, the full stack trace will be outputed.

SEE ALSO
    Similar tools which detects memory leaks:

    Devel::Leak::Object, Devel::LeakGuard::Object.

    Some tools which help to prevent memory leaks:

    Resource::Dispose, Object::Destroyer.
